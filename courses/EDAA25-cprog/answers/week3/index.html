<li><p>For characters requiring 32 bits there are two options available for a C
programmer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wide characters:  these use type wchar_t for objects and the prefix L with
                character constants and strings (of wide chars)
                There are two disadvantages, a type different from plain
                char must be used and it&#39;s a potential waste of memory
                since all characters must use a fixed width container.</li>
<li>Multibyte characters: UTF-8, and other similar encodings. Advantages
                    include: ASCII compatibility, saves memory compared
                    to wchat_t and it is self synchronizing. Quick
                    recap: ASCII requires 7 bits, the eigth bit is used
                    to indicate if it is a non-ASCII character. I.e. set
                    to one when the represented character isn&#39;t ASCII.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The program prints 8. The loop has its own scope.</p></li>
<li><p>Linkage has to do with scope.</p>

<ul>
<li>Internal linkage: file scope (static variables outside of functions and
              externed varibles)</li>
<li>No linkage: only linkage outside of current scope.</li>
<li>External linkage: linkage outside of current scope.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Example:
  ```
  static int a; //internal linkage</p>

<p>int main()
  {
    int a;  //no linkage;
    {
      extern int a; //external linkage (same as outer a)
    }</p>

<pre><code>return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>}
  ```
1.  Type aliasing: two values with incompatible types are used to access the
    same or partially overlapping objects. This is a violation of the ANSI C
    aliasing rules.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Since unsigned integers can only represent positive integers, using the
unsigned version results in being able to represent twice as many positive
numbers. Meaning that the bit representation of -5 is the same as some large
number, when using an unsigned type.</p></li>
<li><p>This process is called integer promotion, and it occurs when performing
arithmetic on a type ranked lower than an int. The value of the varible
is then represented in an int if the original type can be represented within
an int (can be promoted to unsigned int if the value cannot be contained
within the signed int).</p></li>
<li><p>When only needing to represent a small number, one can use a bit-field.
Specifying something like:
<code>
struct {
        unsigned int a : 4;
        unsigned int b : 3;
} rect;
</code></p>

<p>The compiler will then add padding to the struct, making it atleast the size
of an int. (I.e. sizeof(rect) will most likely result in 4.)</p>

<p>We should use unsigned ints since the result of the following example can
result in both 1 and -1. (Due to compilers using different signedness)
```
struct {
  int a:1;
} node;</p>

<p>node.a = 1;</p>

<p>printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, node.a);
```</p></li>
<li><p>Enums are integer-based, meaning that they cannot represent larger numbers
or fractions. When debugging however, they are useful, since the debugger
can print out their variable names.</p></li>
