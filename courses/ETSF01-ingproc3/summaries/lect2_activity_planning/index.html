          <h1>Activity planning</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Time is natures way of stopping everything happening at once.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The objectives of activity planning</h2>

<ul>
<li>Feasability assessment

<ul>
<li>Is the project possible within the required timescales and resources?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Resource allocation

<ul>
<li>What are the most effective ways of allocating resources? When should
the resources be available? </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Detailed costing

<ul>
<li>How much will the project cost? After producing an activity plan, we can
obtain more detailed estimates of costs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Motivation

<ul>
<li>Providing targets and monitoring progress can motivate staff.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Coordination

<ul>
<li>When do the staff need to be transfered between projects to increase 
efficiency?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Activity networks</h2>

<pre><code>           ____  
          |____| 
    ____ /      \ ____
--&gt;|____|        |____|--&gt;
         \ ____ /
          |____|
</code></pre>

<p>Activity networks can be used to assess the feasability of the projects completion
 date, identify when resources are needed, calculate when costs incur, and to coordinate
 the staff between tasks.</p>

<h2>Defining activities</h2>

<p>An activity includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start and end-time</li>
<li>Resource requirements</li>
<li>Duration</li>
<li>Dependencies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Identifying activities</h2>

<p>There are three approaches to identifying the activities or tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Activity based planning</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating a list of all the activities that the project needs. Can be done by creating 
a <strong>Work Breakdown Structure</strong> (WBS, filled with verbs). This involves identifying the main tasks that are 
needed for the project and then breaking them down into lower-level tasks. Too great depth
will result in a large number of small tasks that will be diffcult to manage. Too shallow
project provides insufficient detail.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Product-based approach</p>

<ul>
<li>Consists of producing a <strong>Product Breakdown Structure</strong> (PBS, filled with nouns) and a <strong>Product Flow Diagram</strong> (PFD).
The PFD idicates for each product which other products are required as inputs. With the help of a 
PFD you can easily create an ordered list of activities by identifying the order of products and
which acitivies are needed for them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hybrid approach</p>

<ul>
<li>The hybrid approach is a mix of both. Instead of creating a WBS that is based on the projects 
activities, you create a WBS that is based on the projects products.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Network planning models</h2>

<ul>
<li>Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT)

<ul>
<li>Activity on arrow</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Critical Path Method (CPM)

<ul>
<li>Activity on arrow</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Precedence network

<ul>
<li>Activity on node</li>
<li>most common</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Rules for precedence networks:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Should have only one start node.</li>
<li>Should have only one end node.</li>
<li>Every node has a duration.</li>
<li>Links normally don&#39;t have a duration.</li>
<li>Precedence are the immediate preceding activities.</li>
<li>Time moves from left to right.</li>
<li>A network may not contain loops.</li>
<li>No dangling activities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lagged activities</h2>

<pre><code>   ____        ____        ____                                     
  |____|-----&gt;|____|-----&gt;|____|                                                
            1/ ____ \2                                 
             \|____|/                                   
</code></pre>

<p>Lagged acitivites are dependent on other activities but are initiated with a lag. In the above
example, the second-row activity is started 1 day after the dependent activity and completed 
2 days after the dependent activity has completed.</p>

<h2>Start and finish time of activities</h2>

<ul>
<li>Earliest start (ES)</li>
<li>Earliest finish (EF) = ES + duration</li>
<li>Latest finish (LF) = latest task that can be completed without affecting project end.</li>
<li>Latest start = LF - duration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Forward and backward pass</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Forward pass</p>

<ul>
<li>A forward pass calculates the earliest dates on which each activity may be started and completed.</li>
<li>It does this by going through the dependencies from start to finish and sorting the activities
accordingly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Backward pass</p>

<ul>
<li>A backward pass calculates the latest date at which each activity may be started and completed.</li>
<li>It does this by going backwards and looking at the duration of each activity.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Critical path and float</h2>

<p>The float of an activity is defined as the difference between its earliest start date and latest start date
(or earliest finish - latest finish).
It is a measure of how much the start or completion of an activity may be delayed without
affecting the end of the project.</p>

<ul>
<li>Free float

<ul>
<li>The time by which an activity may be delayed without affecting any subsequent activities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interfering float

<ul>
<li>The difference between total float (Vad är total float, berätta för mig / Andrée) and free float. Indicates how much the activity can be
delayed without delaying the project end date.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The critical path shows the path of activities in a project that define the duration of the whole
project. Any delay in these activities will delay the whole project, which means these activities
have no float.</p>

<p>If a project duration needs to be reduced it is the critical path that needs to be shortened. </p>
