          <h1>Software metrics</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>You cannot control what you cannot measure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[some random dude named Tom DeMarco 1986]</p>

<ul>
<li>SW project management

<ul>
<li>Estimate cost/effort based on historical data</li>
<li>Monitor project progress &amp; risks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Software quality – product quality status</li>
<li>SW process improvement – process efficency &amp; quality</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these require decision support!</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<ul>
<li>Products

<ul>
<li>Lines of code: sw size, impl efficiency</li>
<li>Size of requirements specification</li>
<li>Complexity of design</li>
<li>Test coverage of code</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Processes

<ul>
<li>Actual implementation time</li>
<li>Average time for issue resolution</li>
<li>Number of issues submitted by testers</li>
<li>Effort spent in design phase</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Resources

<ul>
<li>Price of software components</li>
<li>Experience of staff</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Objective or subjective measurments</h2>

<ul>
<li>Objective

<ul>
<li>Lines of code</li>
<li>Actual implementation time – source: reporting system</li>
<li>Module complexity – cyclomatic complexity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subjective

<ul>
<li>Experts or questionnaires with Likert scales (ordinal)</li>
<li>Complexity of system</li>
<li>Usability of system</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Scales</h2>

<ul>
<li>Nominal scale – The nominal type, sometimes also called the qualitative type, 
differentiates between items or subjects based only on their names or categories 
and other qualitative classifications they belong to. Ex. Gender or language.

<ul>
<li>type of fault = {data, function, interface, …}</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ordinal scale – The ordinal type allows for rank order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) 
by which data can be sorted, but still does not allow for relative degree of difference between them. 

<ul>
<li>criticality of fault = critical &gt; important &gt; medium &gt; low</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interval scale – The interval type allows for the degree of difference between items, 
but not the ratio between them. Ex. direction measured in degrees from true or magnetic north.

<ul>
<li>end time = date</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ratio scale – The ratio type takes its name from the fact that measurement is the 
estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit 
magnitude of the same kind. A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) 
zero value. Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. 

<ul>
<li>duration = days</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Scales: allowed usage</h3>

<ul>
<li>Nominal scale: labelling, classifying entries</li>
<li>Ordinal scale: order entries</li>
<li>Interval scale: relative distance between entries</li>
<li>Ratio scale: relative size</li>
</ul>

<h2>Metrics challenges</h2>

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<ul>
<li>Data collected in diﬀerent projects should be comparable</li>
<li>Data collected should be reliable and of high quality</li>
<li>People do not want to collect data that is not used</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solutions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Collect only data that you really need (but all data that you need)</li>
<li>Understand and record the context in which data is collected

<ul>
<li>Product</li>
<li>Team</li>
<li>Process</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Quality assurance for data collection</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goal question metrics (GQM)</h2>

<p>Top-down approach
* Conceptual level – Goals
  What are we trying to achieve?
  Example: shorten lead time of issue management
* Operational level - Questions
  about areas of uncertainty related to the goals. You
  need process knowledge to derive these.
  Example: average time to resolve issues?
* Quantitative level - Metrics
  Measurements that answer the questions
  Ex: time( open → closed ) in issue management system</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>Purpose - improve<br>
Issues (quality focus) -  the efficiency<br>
Object(s) - issues management<br>
Viewpoint - from the project manager’s viewpoint</p>

<p>Align with<br>
* Organisational policy &amp; strategy
* Relevant processes / products
* Organisational structure for viewpoint</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ol>
<li>How characterize the object, i.e. issue management?
<em>Q1: What is current turn-around time for issues of varying prio?</em></li>
<li>How characterize attributes relevant to issues, i.e. issues management efficiency?<br>
<em>Q2: What is the deviation in turn-around time compared to committed response time?</em></li>
<li>How evaluate characteristics of object relevant to issues &amp; viewpoint?
<em>Q3: Is the current performance satisfactory from project manager’s viewpoint?</em><br>
<em>Q4: Is the performance visibly improving?</em></li>
</ol>

<h3>Measurements</h3>

<p>Q/m | Info
--- | ---
<strong>Q1</strong> | <strong>What is current turn-around time for issues of varying prio?</strong>
<em>M1</em> | <em>Average cycle time (open → close), for all prio types</em>
<em>M2</em> | <em>Standard deviation</em>
<em>M3</em> | <em>% cases outside the upper limit, per prio type</em>
<strong>Q2</strong> | <strong>What is the deviation in turn-around time compared to committed response time?</strong>
<em>M4</em> | <em>(Current average cycle time (M1) – Committed response time)/ M1</em>
<em>M5</em> | <em>Subjective evaluation by project manager</em>
<strong>Q3</strong> | <strong>Is the current performance satisfactory from project manager’s viewpoint?</strong>
<em>M5</em> | <em>Subjective evaluation by project manager</em></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>SW Metrics provide decision support

<ul>
<li>Project progress, product quality, process, cost etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Objective vs subjective measurements</li>
<li>Different scales</li>
<li>Goal Question Metrics (GQM): top-down approach</li>
