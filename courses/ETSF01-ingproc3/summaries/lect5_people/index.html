          <h1>Managing people</h1>

<h2>Organisational Behaviour Research</h2>

<p>Aim: Explain people&#39;s behaviour
* Theories á la &quot;If A then B is likely to follow&quot;
* Dependencies, not causal relationships &amp; formulas such as e.g. Chemistry, Physics</p>

<h2>Taylorism</h2>

<p>Select the best people for the job (<strong>!</strong>), instruct them in the best methods,
performance-related pay.</p>

<p>The problems with taylorism is the inflation of the performance-related pay, and
staff exhaustion.</p>

<h2>Hawthorne effect</h2>

<p>By showing an interest in a group the group would perform a lot better, even
though there were no change in work.</p>

<h2>Theory X / Theory Y by McGregor</h2>

<h3>Theory X</h3>

<ul>
<li>The average human has an innate dislike of work</li>
<li>There is a need therefore for coercion, direction, and control</li>
<li>People tend to avoid responsibility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Theory Y</h3>

<ul>
<li>Work is as natural as rest or play</li>
<li>External control and coercion is not necessary</li>
<li>Commitment and objectives is a function of reward</li>
<li>The average human can learn to accept and further seek responsibility</li>
<li>The capacity to exercise imagination and creative qualities distributed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Herzberg</h2>

<ul>
<li>Hygiene or maintenance factors make you dissatisfied if they are not
right, e.g. pay or working conditions</li>
<li>Motivators make you feel the job is worthwhile, e.g. a sense of achievement or the challenge of the work itself</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Oldham-Hackman model</h2>

<p>The satisfaction of a job is based on five factors, listed below. The first three factors (skill variety, task identity and task significance) make the job &quot;meaningful&quot; to the person who is doing it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Skill variety: The number of skills used in the exercise</li>
<li>Task identiy: A sense of ownership of your work</li>
<li>Task significance: Influence on others</li>
<li>Autonomy: Responsibility, authority. Discretion about the way that you do the job</li>
<li>Feedback: Information you get back about the results of your work</li>
</ol>

<p>According to Oldman and Hackman, activities should be designed so that staff follow the progress of a particular product and feel personally associated with it.</p>

<h2>Stress</h2>

<p>Stress is reduced with good project management. Manage the resources
properly (no overtime), clear goals, proper monitor and control to
avoid a crisis.</p>
