          <h1>Risk Management</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>A risk is a potential problem; a problem is a risk that has materialized</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Fairley 1994]</p>

<h2>What can go wrong?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Staff turn-around: quit, moved to other project, illness</li>
<li>Tools do not work as anticipated</li>
<li>Requirements change more than expected</li>
<li>Effort estimates were wrong</li>
<li>Expected input/deliveries are delayed</li>
<li>Quality is not good enough in the end of the project</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is risk?</h2>

<p>&quot;An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project&#39;s objective&quot;
 It consists of both a <strong>cause</strong> and an <strong>effect</strong>
 For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use of new compiler (<strong>cause</strong>)</p>

<ul>
<li>Integration problem &amp;&amp; delayed training phase (<strong>effect</strong>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Low top management priority in Project A (<strong>cause</strong>)</p>

<ul>
<li>Resources (staff) moved from project A to another project (<strong>effect</strong>)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Risky commitments - Overscoping</h3>

<p>The main risk of overscoping is that the project target (scope)
will not be met in <em>time</em> and on budget (<em>cost/effort</em>).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The traditional dev model (waterfall) - sequential &amp; doc-driven</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;<em>overpromise</em> software capabilities in cortractually binding requirements
specification before they <em>understand</em> their risk implications.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Agile dev model (XP/Scrum) - iterative &amp; code driven</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;... neat ideas... I&#39;ll code &#39;em up, and if they <em>don&#39;t fit</em> other 
peoples ideas, we&#39;ll just evolve things until they work.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Risk Management</h3>

<ul>
<li>Risk Assessment

<ul>
<li>Identification (What might go wrong?)</li>
<li>Analysis &amp; prioritization (What are the most serious risks?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Control of risk

<ul>
<li>Planning &amp; Resolution</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Approaches to risk identification:</h4>

<p>Includes but isn&#39;t limited to:
 * Use of checklists, check which risks may come up based on previous experience.
 * Brainstorming - getting knowledgeable stakeholders together to pool concerns.
 * Casual mapping - Identifying possible chains of cause and effect using a map.</p>

<h5>Causal mapping (Applied example)</h5>

<pre><code>                                (DELAY IN PROJECT!)                                           
                               /                  \                
                              /                    \              
                             /                 (People need education)                     
                            /                            \              
                           /                              \              
                          /                                \              
(Unrealistic schedule estimates)                      (Lack of skill)
</code></pre>

<h4>Risk assessment</h4>

<p>Risk exposure = Potential Damage * Probability </p>

<ul>
<li>Not neccesary nor possible to give exact estimates: Qualitative descriptors
, e.g High, Significant, Moderate and Low.</li>
<li>Pripritizethe worst risks (high probability and large damage)</li>
</ul>

<h5>METHOD: Cost-Probability Matrix</h5>

<pre><code>(cost)        _____________________________
             |       |xxxxxx|xxxxxx|xxxxxxx|
High         |       |xxxxxx|xxxxxx|xxxxxxx|                         
             |_______|xxxxxx|xxxxxx|xxxxxxx|    
             |       |      |      |xxxxxxx|
Significant  |       |      |      |xxxxxxx|                              
             |_______|______|______|xxxxxxx|      
             |       |      |      |       |
Moderate     |       |      |      |       |                                
             |_______|______|______|_______|      
             |       |      |      |       |
Low          |       |      |      |       |
             |_______|______|______|_______|
                Low    Med    Med+    High   (probability)                      
</code></pre>

<p>The worst risks are indicated by X&#39;es since they both have a high cost and probability.</p>

<h5>METHOD: Decision Tree</h5>

<p>In this scenario we ponder on wether or not to extend or replace a system.
The outcome of this depends on if the market expands or not.
If we extend the system and the market expands we lose -100.000$, if it doesn&#39;t expand
we will gain 75.000$.
If we replace the system and the market expands we gain 250.000$, if it doesn&#39;t
expand we lose 50.000$
```</p>

<pre><code>                ,_______________     Net Product Value (NPV)                                               
  ,____________/ (20%) Expansion     -100.000 $                                                     
 /   Extend    \ (80%) No Expansion   75.000 $                                                             
/               `---------------                                        
</code></pre>

<p>/<br>
  /<br>
D<br>
  \<br>
   \<br>
    \               ,_______________<br>
     <code>-------------´ (20%) Expansion      250.000 $                                          
         Replace   \ (80%) No Expansion  -50.000 $                                               
</code>---------------<br>
```
If we extend the risk exposure is:
RE = -100.000 * 0.2 + 75.000 * 0.8 = 40.000
And if replace the risk exposure is:
RE = 250.000 * 0.2 - 50.000 * 0.8 = 10.000
Therefore in this example we should obviously <strong>EXTEND THE SYSTEM!!!!!!</strong></p>

<h4>Risk planning: There are five alternatives:</h4>

<p><strong>AARMT</strong>
* <strong>A</strong> cceptance
* <strong>A</strong> voidance - Find a risk-free solution.
* <strong>R</strong> eduction - Reduce probability
* <strong>M</strong> itigation - Reduce damage, e.g. taking backups
* <strong>T</strong> ransfer - e.g. outsource</p>

<h4>METHOD: Risk reduction leverage</h4>

<h5>Risk reduction leverage is a method of comparing different options by comparing risk exposures.</h5>

<p>RRL = (RE_before - RE_after)/(cost of risk reduction)</p>

<p>RE_before is risk expose before risk reduction, e.g. 1% chance of
a fire causing $200k dmg.</p>

<p>RE_after is risk exposure after risk reduction, e.g. $500 alarm
which reduced probability of fire dmg by 0.5%</p>

<p>RRL = (1% of $200k - 0.5% of $200k)/$500 = 2
RRL &gt; 1.00 <em>therefore worth doing</em></p>

<h4>The risk of delays in completing activities, examples.</h4>

<p>| Risk |
| ---- |
| Personell shortfalls |
| <strong>Unrealistic time and cost estimates</strong> |
| Developing the wrong software functions |
| Developing the wrong user interface |
| Gold plating |
| Late changes to requirements |
| Shortfalls in externally supplied components |
| Shortfalls in externally performed tasks |
| Real time performance problems |
| Development technically too difficult |</p>

<h4>METHOD: Using PERT</h4>

<p><strong>PERT = Program Evaluation and Review Technique</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERT - A statistical tool for analysing completion time</strong></p>

<h5>Method</h5>

<p>Three estimates are produced for each activity (task)</p>

<ul>
<li>(m) Most likely time</li>
<li>(a) Optimistic time</li>
<li>(b) Pessimistic</li>
<li>(t_e) &#39;expected time&#39; t_e = (a +4m +b)/6</li>
<li>(S) &#39;activity standard deviation&#39; S = (b-a)/6</li>
</ul>

<h5>Calculations</h5>

<p>Suppose the dependecies are as such:
```</p>

<hr>

<p>|TASK A| -&gt; |TASK B| -&gt; |TASK C|<br>
 ¨¨¨¨¨¨      ¨¨¨¨¨¨      ¨¨¨¨¨¨
```</p>

<p>| Task | a | m | b | t_e | s |
|------|---|---|---|-----|---|
|  A   | 10| 12| 16| 13  | 1 |
|  B   | 8 | 10| 14| 10  | 1 |
|  C   | 20| 24| 38| 26  | 3 |
|A+B+C |   |   |   | 49  | 3 |</p>

<p>The calculations are completed. Just use the previously mentioned formulae if
you want to review them.</p>

<h5>Assessing the likelihood of meeting a target</h5>

<ul>
<li>Imagine now that the target for completing A+B+C was 52 days.</li>
<li>Calculate the Z-value as (T - t_e)/s = (52 - 48.65) / 3.32 = 1.01 </li>
<li>Match the Z-value with a probability by using a pre-existing table.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which results in a 15% chance of <strong>NOT</strong> meeting the target 52 days.
And that&#39;s PERT for you, kids!</p>

<h4>Problems with estimates of task duration</h4>

<ul>
<li>Estimators usually add a safety zone to cover difficulties</li>
<li>Developers work to the estimate, meaning the time is lost</li>
<li>No advantage is taken of opportunities where tasks can finish early - and
provide a buffer for later activities</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Parkinson&#39;s law: </p>

<p>Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion</p>

<p>=&gt; All buffers are usually consumed by end of the project.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Basic Ideas of Critical Chain</h4>

<p>To reduce time wasted, a critical chain is constructed as such:</p>

<pre><code> _____ __
|_____&#39;__| ____ __
          |____&#39;__| ___ __
                   |___&#39;__|
</code></pre>

<p>Move all buffers to the end and halve them.</p>

<pre><code> _____
|_____| ____ 
       |____| ___ ___
             |___&#39;___|
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, the buffers have been reduced in half so that people don&#39;t waste time!!!</p>

<h4>Critical Chain Approach</h4>

<ol>
<li>Ask the estimators for two estimates

<ul>
<li>Most likely duration: 50% chance of meeting this</li>
<li>Comfort zone: additional time needed to have 95% chance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Schedule all activities using most likely values and
starting all activities on latest start date</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>“Critical chain” the same as “critical path” but resources
also considered</li>
<li>Put a project buffer at the end of the critical chain with
duration 50% of sum of comfort zones of the activities
on the critical chain</li>
<li>During project execution monitor how much of the
buffer that has been used</li>
<li>Supported in tools, e.g. through add-on to MS Project</li>
</ul>

<h4>Executing  and monitoring Critical Chain plans</h4>

<ul>
<li>Principle: focus your efforts - ”multitasking is evil”

<ul>
<li>No chain of tasks is started earlier than
scheduled, but once it has started is finished as
soon as possible</li>
<li>This means the activity following the current one
starts as soon as the current one is completed,
even if this is early – the relay race principle</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fever charts are used to monitor progress and catch tasks at risk</li>
</ul>
