          <h1>Monitor &amp; control</h1>

<p>Monitor &amp; control is needed since plan != reality.
By using this the aim is to reach
* Goals: good product
* Budget: cost
* Timelineness: market window</p>

<h2>Monitor</h2>

<ul>
<li>Objective: check if project is on track with plan</li>
<li>Different kinds of data/measurements

<ul>
<li>Data from reports</li>
<li>Subjective data on completion rate</li>
<li>Data comparing actual cost/value and planned cost/value</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Cost vs Time</h3>

<p><em>Behind time</em> but <em>under budget</em>, ex: delayed due to not
deploying committed staff</p>

<p>On time but <em>over budget</em>, ex: additional resources have
been added to cope with work load.</p>

<h3>Collecting the data</h3>

<ul>
<li>Time sheet: Report hours, percentage done, etc.</li>
<li>Red/amber/green (RAG) reporting: Simply chose the color of
likelihood to reach deadline of specific task. Do this for every
week/day etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visualizing</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Gantt chart: Basically multiple activity bars, indicating
when a task should be started and done, as well as the current
progress. Preferably the progress of the bar should be aligned
with <em>today</em>.
<code>
|                  TODAY         |
|--DATE-| 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |
Task A:      |====&gt;_________|
Task B: |==============&gt;_________|
Task C: |=============&gt;|
</code>
Where <em>Task A</em> is behind schedule, <em>Task B</em> is on schedule but
not done, and <em>Task C</em> was completed on schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>Slip chart: A Gantt chart with a vertical line showing the
progress.</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>|                  TODAY         |
|--DATE-| 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |
                    |
                   /
Task A:      |====&gt;_________|
                   \
                    |
                     \
                      \
Task B: |==============&gt;_________|
                      /
                     /
                    |
                     \
                      \
Task C: |=============&gt;|
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Brigette&#39;s timeline plots planned time along the horizontal
axis and elapsed time along the vertical axis. A diagonal line
means that the task was delayed, a dot/star means the task is
complete.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>         Task A  Task B Task C
| T | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| 1 | .       |       |   |
| 2 |     .   |        \  |
| 3 |         *         \  \
| 4 |             .     |   \
| 5 |                 . |    \
| 6 |                   * . 
| 7 |                         .
</code></pre>

<p>Where <em>Task A</em> was finished on schedule, <em>Task B</em> was
delayed but is finished. <em>Task C</em> was delayed even more and
is still incomplete.</p>

<ul>
<li>Burn-Down Charts (Scrum): A chart displaying the ideal velocity
of the project, and a line displaying the actual progress.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>| T | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| 1 | . ___
| 2 |     .\
| 3 |       \ .
| 4 |        \__  . 
| 5 |           \_____.___ 
| 6 |                     .\ 
| 7 |                       \_.
</code></pre>

<p>The dots represent the ideal veolocity, the lines the actual.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fever chart (critical chain). The upper part indicates
that the project most likely will be late, the lower part
that the project will finish early, and the middle that
it is on schedule.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * -
* * * * * * * * Y * * *       -
* * * * * * * Y * *         - -
* * * * * * Y Y *         - - -

    K   Y     - - M M - - - - - 
  K     Y   - - M - - - - - - -

Y Y - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Y - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Y - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
</code></pre>

<p>Where <em>Y</em> is late, <em>K</em> is on schedule, and <em>M</em> is early.</p>

<h3>Earned value analysis</h3>

<p>Earned value analysis is based on assigning a &quot;value&quot; to each
task or work, based on the original expenditures forecasts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Planned value (PV) or Budgeted cost of
work scheduled (BCWS): Original estimate</li>
<li>Earned value (EV) or Budgeted cost
of work performed (BCWP): Work completed this far</li>
<li>Actual cost (AC) or Actual
cost of work performed (ACWS): Actual work performed this far</li>
<li>Budget at completion (BAC): The budget when the project is done</li>
<li>Estimate at completion (EAC):
Estimated budget at completion, updated as the project progresses</li>
</ul>

<h3>Earned value tracking</h3>

<p>When the baseline budget has been established, the project can be tracked
as it progresses.</p>

<ul>
<li>Schedule variance (SV): EV - AV. Difference between the estimated
and actual value.</li>
<li>Time variance (TV): Difference between planned finish date and actual.</li>
<li>Cost variance: EV - AC. Indicates the difference between the earned value
and the actual cost. A negative CV means that the project is over cost.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Performance ratios</h3>

<p>Value for money.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cost performance indicator (CPI) = EV / AC</li>
<li>Schedule performance indicator (SPI) = EV/PV</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre><code>BAC = 100
Actal cost = 80
|===========&gt;        |
    EV = 60 ^        ^ PV = 100
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>CPI = EV / AC = 60 / 80 = 75 % =&gt; over budget</li>
<li>SPI = EV / PV = 60 / 100 = 60 %</li>
<li><p>EAC = BAC / CPI = 100 / 0.75 = 133</p></li>
<li><p>Cost variance = EV - AC = 60 - 80 = -20</p></li>
<li><p>Budget variance = PV - AC = 100 - 80 = 20</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule variance = EV - PV = 60 - 100 = -40</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Prioritizing monitoring</h3>

<p>Focus on monitoring based on risk
* Critical path activities: Any delay in an activity in the critical
path will cause a delay in the project complete date.
* Activities with no free float: A delay of an activity with no free float
might cause a delay on some subsequent activities. But it might not delay
the whole project.
* Activities with less than a specified float: Same as above.
* High risk activities: Activities that have a high chance of failing/delay.
* Activities using critical resources: Such activities might be expensive.
* Activities with external dependencies: Same</p>

<h2>Control</h2>

<p>Almost any project will be delayed at some point, the project
manager must recognize when this is happening and take immediate action! <strong>dum dum!</strong></p>

<h3>Get back on track</h3>

<ul>
<li>Try to shorten critical path by adding resources

<ul>
<li>Overtime</li>
<li>Re-allocate existing staff to more critical activities</li>
<li>Get more staff</li>
<li>Reduce quality of some activities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reconsider activity dependencies

<ul>
<li>Over-lap activities to avoid waiting for completion of another</li>
<li>Split activities to remove dependencies to activities / critical resources</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Typical change control process</h3>

<ol>
<li>One or more stakeholder might perceive the <strong>need for a change</strong></li>
<li>Affected/receiving party (e.g. customer rep for customer request)
decide that the change is valid and worthwhile. <strong>Request for change</strong> (RFC or CR)
to the development management for change control management</li>
<li><strong>Change investigated</strong> by developer. Impact and cost estimated. All
impact should be considered including testing, long-term maintenance etc</li>
<li>The impact investigation is shared with initiating stakeholder who
<strong>decides to proceed or not</strong></li>
<li>RFC and its impact discussed with all stakeholders, typically at a
<strong>change control board meeting</strong> where RFC is approved or rejected.</li>
<li>.... Varied process for implementating change. Should involve
<strong>communication</strong> and <strong>tracking of results</strong></li>
</ol>
