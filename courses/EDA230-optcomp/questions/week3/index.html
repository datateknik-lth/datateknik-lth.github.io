<h2>Partially anticipated</h2>

<p>A computation <em>E</em> is partially anticipated at a point <em>p</em> if there is a path <em>P</em> from
<em>p</em> to a computation at a point <em>q</em> and <em>E</em> is preserved along <em>P</em>.
<em>Jonas&#39;s definition:</em> An expression is <strong>anticipated</strong> at a point <em>p</em> in the CFG if
it is certain that it will be evaluated with all operands having the same
value on all paths to <em>p</em>.</p>

<h2>Fully anticipated</h2>

<p>A computation <em>E</em> is fully anticipated at a point <em>p</em> if it is partially anticipated
along every path from <em>p</em> to program exit.</p>

<h2>Down safe</h2>

<p>A point <em>q</em> is down-safe with respect to a computation <em>E</em>, if <em>E</em> is <strong>fully</strong>
<strong>anticipated</strong> at <em>q</em>. Since <em>SSAPRE</em> is not allowed to to add computations which
wouldn&#39;t be there otherwise, the following code can&#39;t be optimized:
<code>
while (a &lt; b) {
    i += x * y;
    a++;
}
</code>
Since the <code>while</code> loop might never run, this can be fixed by changing the
<code>while</code> into an <code>if</code> and <code>do-while</code>.</p>

<h1>SSAPRE</h1>

<ol>
<li> Insert Ф-functions. Ф is inserted at <code>DF+(R + A)</code>, where
R is the set of vertices with real occurrences of E, and A is the set of
vertices with assignments to an operand of E.</li>
<li> Rename. All occurrences (real, Ф, and Ф-operand). Renaming uses the
SSA-renaming algorithm. Ф-operands corresponding to another Ф-operand
is set to <strong>⊥</strong>.</li>
<li> Finalize1

<ul>
<li>  Downsafety: Ф is downsafe if there is a real occurrence of the
computation after Ф but before the program exit or modification of
the computation&#39;s value after the Ф function. SSAPRE may not add a
computation which might not be used at all. I.e. in the following code,
<code>x * y</code> might never be needed.
<code>
while (a &lt; b)  {
    i += x * y;
    a++;
}
</code>
This can be fixed by changing
the <code>while</code> into an <code>if</code> and <code>do-while</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>*   Availability: Find the Ф-functions where an expression safely can be
    made available, and then find the latest point to insert the expression
    (reduce live ranges). `can_be_available` is set to `false` if the
    Ф-function is not downsafe and has a **⊥** operand, this is
    propagated to every operand&#39;s definition. `later` is initially set to
    `can_be_available`, but if there exits an operand which is not
    **⊥** and has a real use, then it is set to false (and propagated
    to each operand).

*   Modify: For each Ф-function which satisfy `will_be_available`
    (`can_be_avail &amp;&amp; !later`), the expression is inserted at each incoming
    edge where the expression is not available.
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li> Finalize2: Set a <code>save</code> flag at each real occurrence that should save its
computation.</li>
