<li> Operator Strength Reduction</li>
<li> A graph of connected variables</li>
<li> See bellow</li>
<li> A variable defined by a multiplication of an induction variable and a
region constant is found. The multiplication is then replaced by an
addition</li>
<li><p>The purpose of linear functon test replacement is to replace the bound
calculation of a loop thus eliminating the need for an index. OSR would
in this case have replaced the dereferencing by a pointer incrementation
as bellow:</p>

<p>After OSR:
<code>c
float *p = &amp;a[0];
for (i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
    s += *p;
    p++;
}
</code>
After linear function test replacement:
<code>c
float *p = &amp;a[0];
float *u = &amp;a[100];
while (p &lt; u) {
    s += *p;
    p++;
}
</code>
As noted above, this eliminates the need for an index.</p></li>
<li><p>A vertex  is control dependent on vertex u if:</p>

<ol>
<li> there exists a non-null path from u to v and v post dominates every
vertex on the path after u</li>
<li> v does not strictly post dominate u</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>After the CFG has been created a DFS from start vertex s is performed,
all unvisited vertices are deleted. Then all statements which cannot
effect program output is deleted. This is performed with a live analysis:</p></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>* All statements which directly affect output are marked as prelive
* Their operands mark additional statements as live and so forth
* Reads are marked prelive, otherwise the input would get out of sync

When a branch statement is marked live, the operands deciding the branch
should also be marked live.

The Simplify function takes the analysed code and removes vertices which
aren&#39;t live. As such, it needs to update the edges to and from the live 
vertices surrounding the dead vertex.
The procedure also needs to handle the updating of PHI functions.
When a vertex is bypassed the function also recreates the dominator tree.

<h1>Terminology</h1>

<h2>Region</h2>

<p>Is a strongly conneced component in the control flow graph G</p>

<h2>Region constant</h2>

<p>Is either a compile-time constant, or a variable whose definition strictly
dominates every vertex in the region</p>

<h2>Induction variable</h2>

<p>A variable is an induction variable with respect to a region if within the
region it is only incremented or decremented by a region constant</p>

<h2>Strongly connected component</h2>

<p>A set of vertices S, such that for every <code>u,v belonging to S</code> there is a path
between <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>.</p>

<h2>Tarjan&#39;s Algorithm</h2>

<p>Do a DFS of the CFG and push each discovered node to a stack S, when an already
visited node is encountered this node becomes the lowlink of all the nodes on
the stack S. This is then considered a SCC.</p>

<p>If there are more nodes after this, repeat the above. The result is then a
separate SCC.</p>
