<p><strong>Branch Prediction</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pipelined processors use speculative computing to be more efficient. This
means that they will need to guess the outcome of a branch. This can be done
with the help of a <em>Branch History Table</em>, where the results of the last
branches are stored. Without this optimization, instructions following the branch
cannot be loaded until the outcome has been determined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Rename Registers</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are used to eliminate <em>anti- and output dependencies</em>. The concerned hazards are write after read and write
after write.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Reorder buffer</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reorder buffer is used for <em>out-of-order execution</em>. It allows
instructions to be committed in-order. I.e. instructions may be executed out
of order but the result of the program, is the same as if it wasn&#39;t
rearranged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Direct mapped cache</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a direct map cache there&#39;s a function that maps the address to a
particular row, so only one comparator is needed (<code>i = addr % CACHE_SIZE</code>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Set associative cache</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maps address to set instead of row. I.e. a specific set will be searched for
the wanted row. Done with comparators (see below).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fully associative cache</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look through each row in the cache for the wanted address. Done with
comparators, that execute the lookup in parallel. For real applications this
is unfeasible since there would have to a lot of comparators. The space can
be utilized in a better way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Temporal locality</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Objects are close in time, i.e. used near each other in time</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Spatial locality</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Objects are close to each other in memory. For best cache performance,
objects that are used closely in time should be kept close spatially as
well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>RISC</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reduced instruction set computer</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Comparators</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>For each line in the cache set, they compare the address of the stored one
with the requested address.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Block size</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The number of bytes fetched when a cache miss occurs. To benefit from spatial
locality, it should be at least 32 bytes. With a large block size, a miss
might overwrite data that will be read next. I.e. few of the loaded bytes
will be of use</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Arithmetic shift</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When dividing value by a power of two, we can shift the numerator right same
number of times as the order of the denominator (i.e. 4 times for 16 and 2
times for 4). When this is done with negative integers we need to add one
to the solution if the computed value is not a power of two.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>True dependence</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>An instruction <code>I_1</code>is followed by <code>I_2</code>. If <code>I_1</code> produces a value that
<code>I_2</code> needs, then there is a true dependence between them. Stalls caused by
these cannot be avoided by the processor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Anti dependence</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>I_1</code> will read a value that a later instruction will overwrite. The latter
needs to wait until it is safe to overwrite the value. Can be avoided with
rename registers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Output dependence</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two instructions will overwrite a location and their writes must happen in
that order. Can be avoided with rename registers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Input dependence</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two instructions will read the same location. This does not impact execution.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Common questions</h1>

<p><strong>Explain why a five-stage pipelined RISC processor usually does not see a
five-time speedup when running most programs.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pipeline stalls due to taken branches
Pipeline stalls due to sequences such as a load directly followed by use
of the fetched value
Delay due to cache miss
Instructions such as divide taking multiple cycles to execute</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Describe a program that can come close to a five-time speedup</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A program which does not suffer cache misses, and none of the other
problems above, which sometimes can be achieved by loop-unrolling and many
integer computations</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How is chaos averted when using speculative execution? (I.e. that a register
or memory location is modified only if it should be)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The CPU will fetch the instructions for the guessed outcome of the
branch. But it is not allowed to modify memory until it knows for certain
that the branch was taken. If it was incorrect the instructions fetched
are simply ignored and the correct instructions are fetched. It uses
<em>register renaming</em> to avoid corrupting the actual registers until it
knows if the branch was taken or not. If it should predict wrong, it will
need to invalidate the instructions. For this, the <em>reorder buffer</em> is
used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Why do we not have fully associative caches in CPUs?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We would need too many comparators (parallel lookup units) to find the
wanted address. The space needed can be better utilized by other
components.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What is the purpose of having sets in a cache?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The purpose is to reduce the risk of two or more addresses being mapped
to the same row in the cache. This would result in cache misses as the
value would be overwritten many times. Set associative caches are used to
divide the cache so that the need for comparators is minimized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In a 4-way set associative cache, where can the data at memory address A be
placed?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In one of the sets defined by a function (<code>i = addr % CACHE_SIZE</code>). The
sets will each contain four <em>cache blocks</em>, thus the need for the same
amount of comparators (since the address may be placed anywhere within the
cache block).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>When reallocating memory, what is the advantage of <code>realloc</code> over a
combination of <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>With <code>malloc</code> you can run out of memory in a situation where <code>realloc</code>
would find memory. <code>realloc</code> also has a chance to be faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Write a function to check that a void pointer <code>ptr</code> has a value which is a
multiple of <code>size_t a</code></strong></p>

<pre><code class="c">#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

int aligned(void *ptr, size_t a)
{
        /* We know that &#39;a&#39; is a power of two, i.e. only has one bit set to one.
         * This means that if we subtract 1 from this number we get &#39;k&#39; ones.
         * Where k comes from `a = 2^k`.
         *
         * If &#39;ptr&#39; is a multiple of &#39;a&#39;, then all of its least significant bits
         * will be zero.
         *
         * Example: a = 4 and ptr contains 48
         *
         * Then                    a   == 0b100
         *                         a-1 == 0b011
         *                         ptr == 0b110000
         *      (uintptr_t)ptr &amp; (a-1) == 110000 &amp; 011 == 0
         */
        uintptr_t b = (uintptr_t)ptr;
        return (b &amp; (a - 1)) == 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Checking if something is a power of two</strong></p>

<pre><code class="c">bool two_power(int x)
{
        /* The idea of the right side is explained in the &#39;aligned&#39;
         * function above
         *
         * If a &lt; 0 || a == INT_MIN, then this would yield true, despite
         * not being a powers of two
         */
        return x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (x &amp; (x-1)) == 0;
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p><strong>gcov</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Counts exact execution counts for each source line as well as branch
frequencies (taken/non-taken). Needs special flags for the compilation and
affects compiler optimization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>gprof</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Execution times are shown for the different functions and the number of times
each function is called and by which function. Same disadvantages as <em>gcov</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>OProfile</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can count the number of times certain events happen such as: clock cycles,
executed instructions cache misses. Can be presented at source code level or
instruction level. Advantages over <em>gcov</em>/<em>gprof</em> are that it does not need
special flags and should be used with the highest level of optimization. A
disadvantage is that to change what it should count, the user must have root
privileges on the machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>valgrind</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can detect many kinds of pointer and memory allocation errors. It can also
produce statistics of heap memory usage and cache performance.  Doesn&#39;t
require flags, but works best when debugging information is available. Is
much slower than other tools (e.g. 100 times slower execution).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>cachegrind</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cachegrind is used for performance measurement of the cache and the
processor&#39;s branch prediction. In contrast to valgrind, it is better to
enable optimization (and -g). Is used together with valgrind
<code>valgrind --cache-sim=no --branch-sim=yes --tool=cachegrind...</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>massif</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Measures the amount of heap memory different parts of a program allocates. Is
used valgrind to generate data. Can be plotted in nice graphs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>strace</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prints to a file or to <code>stderr</code> each system call a process makes, with
arguments and return value, as well as signals it receives.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>C</h1>

<p><code>alloca</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Macro for allocating on the stack used when the data size is reasonable and
it isn&#39;t returned from the allocating function</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Arenas</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A chunk of memory allocated at once. Used instead of making many calls to
<code>malloc</code>. When all the work is complete, the arena can be deallocated at
once. This makes arenas useful when many calls to <code>free</code> occur at once.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Free-lists</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it happens often that objects of the same size are allocated and
deallocated, they can be put in a free-list instead of deallocating them
using <code>free</code>. If the objects are of different sizes or only deallocated near
the end of an execution, free-lists are <em>not</em> useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Arithmetic and Logical Shift</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Arithmetic shift keeps the sign, logical will shift in zeros.  To get logical
shift, you need an <code>unsigned</code>.  To get an arithmetic, simply use a <code>signed</code>
type.</p>

<p><strong>OBS!</strong> Shifting <em>right</em> is not standardized to be logical or arithmetic. Meaning
it is up to the compiler implementation to decide. Usually, the above applies
(GCC and Clang), but it doesn&#39;t have to. Write a program to test your
compiler.</p>

<p>Below is an implementation of getting the ones in an <code>unsigned long long</code></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="c">unsigned count(unsigned long long a)
{
    unsigned ones = 0;

    for (; a &gt; 0; a &gt;&gt;= 1)
            if (a &amp; 1) ones++;

    return ones;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rearranging fields in structs</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not allowed to be done by the compiler. To minimize the struct size,
you need to arrange the fields such that the alignment padding is minimized.</p>
