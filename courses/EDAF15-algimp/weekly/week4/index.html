          <h1>Week 4</h1>

<ol>
<li>Which are the five main steps in instruction execution on a RISC processor?

<ul>
<li>IF (instruction fetch)</li>
<li>ID (instruction decode)</li>
<li>EX (execute)</li>
<li>MEM (read from or write to <em>memory</em>)</li>
<li>WB (write back, save result in destination register)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In a five-stage pipeline of a processor which can issue (i.e. start executing)
one instruction every clock cycle, what is the ideal performance execution?

<ul>
<li>Ideally a pipelined processor starts an instruction each clock cycle</li>
</ul></li>
<li>During the 1970&#39;s, most computers did not take advantage of pipelining. Why?

<ul>
<li>Too difficult to implement in the CISC processors being used</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why can there be a pipeline stall after a load instruction but not after an
add instruction?

<ul>
<li>Because the add instruction can be completed immediately the value is
forwarded if needed, but a load instruction will take one extra cycle if
the value is needed immediately after its execution</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When more than one instruction starts executing every clock cycle, it
becomes very likely that a conditional branch instruction will be executed
in a clock cycle. It is important to start fetching new instructions to be
executed after the branch but since the processor cannot know for sure
whether a conditional branch will be taken or not, it must guess which
instructions to fetch. What is the table used for this called?

<ul>
<li>Branch history table</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By guessing which instructions should be executed, a superscalar processor
uses speculative <em>execution</em>. Consider a store instruction that is executing
speculatively. Which mechanism is used to prevent the store from modifying
memory before it is certain that it will be executed?

<ul>
<li>Reorder buffer</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is the purpose of <em>rename registers</em>?

<ul>
<li>To avoid data true dependence (i.e. Ins1 produces a value Ins2 needs)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What do the terms <em>temporal</em> and <em>spatial locality</em> mean?

<ul>
<li>Temporal means that the instructions are close in time and spatial that
they are close in memory</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
