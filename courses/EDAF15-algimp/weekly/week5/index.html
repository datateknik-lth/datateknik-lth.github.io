<ol>
<li>Which are the two forms of locality?

<ul>
<li>Spatial and temporal</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is meant by a cache block?

<ul>
<li>The bytes read from memory on a cache miss are collectively called a <em>cache block</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A  cache  is  divided  into  a  number  of  sets,  and  when  an  address
is searched all rows in a particular set are checked to see if that row con-
tains the searched address and needed data. What is a cache called if it is
described as follows:

<ul>
<li>The cache has only one set - <strong>fully associative</strong></li>
<li>Each set has four rows - <strong>set-associative cache</strong></li>
<li>The number of sets and rows are equal - <strong>direct-mapped cache</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>When there are multiple rows in a set, are they searched in sequence or are
the hardware address comparators duplicated so that they work in parallel?

<ul>
<li>The hardware address comparators are duplicated so that they work in parallel</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is the cache block size on the power machine?

<ul>
<li>128 bytes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modern optimizing compilers use a representation which makes it relatively
easy analyze which statement has modified a variable. What is this
representation called?

<ul>
<li>SSA (Static Single Assignment) form</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is the purpose of instruction scheduling?

<ul>
<li>To improve performance by reducing the number of pipeline stalls suffered
during execution</li>
</ul></li>
